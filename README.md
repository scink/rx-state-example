#### TODO:
- get rid of redux!!!
- implement HOC WithRX
- make actions of storybook work. they don't now
- migrate to @kadira/storybook. now it has an error in `TreeNode` like\
`Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'string' of undefined`\
`@storybook` has some problems with autoimport in webstorm because of naming of styles
